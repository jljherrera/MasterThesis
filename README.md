Code for the authentication and encryption code using multivariate quadratic equations
This repo hosts sage, python and C programs that implement UOV which is an underlying layer for an implementation
of an authentication and stream cipher based in multivariate quadratic polynomials.

The code is not optimized, but it rather shows the proof of concept working.

Details on how to run this programs can be found in https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/tesisgraduados/2015/ResumenJoseHerrera.html
